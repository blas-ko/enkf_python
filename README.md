# enkf_python
Vanilla implementation of the Ensemble Kalman filter in Python.

# Requirements
This library only needs `numpy`, but might change in the future. The example [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/blas-ko/enkf_python/blob/main/notebooks/ensemble_kalman_filter_with_examples.ipynb) requires `matplotlib` for a basic visualization of results.

# Disclaimer
This library is a work in progress and will likely expand in the future.
